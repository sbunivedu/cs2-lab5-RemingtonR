Due to customers being added to the queue once every 15 seconds, and the cashiers 
check out once every 120 seconds, below 8 cashiers, the customers enqueue faster
then they can be checked out and they accumulate therefore, increasing the time in line.
If there are 8 or more cashiers then the customers are dequeued faster than they
are enqueued and are limited by the speed of the cashiers.
